*alpaka - An Abstraction Library for Parallel Kernel Acceleration*

Its aim is to provide performance portability across accelerators by abstracting the underlying levels of parallelism.

The library is platform-independent and supports the concurrent and cooperative use of multiple devices, including host CPUs (x86, ARM, RISC-V, and Power8+) and GPUs from different vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel).
A variety of accelerator backends—CUDA, HIP, SYCL, OpenMP, and serial execution—are available and can be selected based on the target device.
Only a single implementation of a user kernel is required, expressed as a function object with a standardized interface.
This eliminates the need to write specialized CUDA, HIP, SYCL, OpenMP, or threading code.
Moreover, multiple accelerator backends can be combined to target different vendor hardware within a single system and even within a single application.
